# Codewayy_Python_Series

## Task1
> **_Here goes the first task of Python_Series!_**

This Repo is created for begineer's you will find the basic code in which you will get the concept of integers,float,variables. and an string program with concatination.

## Task2
_In this task you will learn about the non primitive data structure-_

1.List

2.Tuple

3.Set

4.Dictinoaries

In above task you will find the programs on this data structure's and various method of them.

_And some Basic Questions with Answer's on them_

## Task3
_Working with loops-_
> In this task we have created diff **_functions and loops_**
ther are 3 programs in this task first program uses 5 different function and print the Personal Details, Marks Obtained, Percentage, Grade and the Master function which 
call other functions.
 
>Second program takes the input string from user - concatinate it and print the length of string. 

>Third task uses the loop to print the no from 1 to 10 except 3 and 7

1. while loop

2. for loop

## Task4
> This task contains two programs

1.one to print all the prime of entered element in matrix

2.second program shows the implementation of modules

There are 3 subprogram which cotains various function

1. **_list_**- prints sq of no , max no, min no, and sum of element

2.**_string_**- prints length of string, vowels in string, and middle element of string

3.**_logicaloperator's_**- shows the use of AND | OR | NOT
